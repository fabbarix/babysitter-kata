This is my sumbission for the Kata.

## Requirements

This code has the following requirements:

  - nodejs installed, at least version 12.2.0

## Setting up

Before running the code or the tests, make sure to install the required _npm_ libraries:

You can easily run the tests by executing:

```bash

```

The results of the tests will be shown as the *specs* are run.
